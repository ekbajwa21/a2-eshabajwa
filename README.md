## How many more credits do your students need?
This site takes in a students name, how many credits they have earned, and how many credits they need. Then it calculates how many
credits they need.

## Technical Achievements
I created single page app that provides a way to enter student data and displays server data (after hitting the submit buttion, didn't have time to fix that bug.)
The drived field Credits Left
